When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- To collaborate with others
- To store files that can be easily pull anywhere

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- I want each change to be logical. So I would want to decide when to pull/push changes on GitHub

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Clone is copying repository from GitHub to local or local to local
- Fork is cloning repository within GitHub
- Branch is adding another commit outside the master branch
