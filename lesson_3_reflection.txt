When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- To collaborate with others
- To store files that can be easily pull anywhere

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- I want each change to be logical. So I would want to decide when to pull/push changes on GitHub

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Clone is copying repository from GitHub to local or local to local
- Fork is cloning repository within GitHub
- Branch is adding another commit outside the master branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- So we know what we have made changes to the state of the remote when we pulled.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
- I will have to send files and compare files manually or using some programs which would be mush less convenient.
